  The build result may have a version (from pom.xml). If you don't want to pass this version to the application server, you can use this flag.

  WSO2 AS will use the version to deploy a file with name <tt>[targetname]#[version].war</tt> , which indicated the embedded Tomcat to deploy a sub-context. 
  This is good, if you want to deploy two versions at the same time. Sometimes this is not, what you want to have.
